Hello!

This script was created during my studies in the animation course at Animation School. It helps set up scene, camera, render, and playback settings at the beginning of the work.

The script consists of 6 buttons, each accompanied by a brief comment explaining its function.

Button Playback 150 - sets up playback for 150 frames.
Button Setup camera - adds a camera to the scene and configures camera FocalLength, Film Aspect ratio, and Display Film Gate.
Button Step MODE - transforms keys into Step mode.
Button Render Settings - configures Image size to 1920*1080 and Device aspect ratio to 1.778.
Button Framerate 24fps - sets up Framerate and playback speed in Preferences.
Button Playblast an Animation - initiates a 1920*1080 .mov playblast.

Feel free to use it for your scenes!
